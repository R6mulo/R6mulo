# 👋 Hi, I'm R6mulo!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **programming student** passionate about technology, game development, and creativity.  
While I currently work in a different professional field, I'm dedicating my time and energy to mastering code and building meaningful projects—especially in the areas of **modding** and **game development**.

🎓 I'm currently studying at **Oracle Next Education (ONE)**, a program by Oracle in partnership with Alura, focused on empowering new developers through quality education and real-world challenges.

🛠️ Here on GitHub, you'll find some of my experiments, personal projects, and game mods—like **[Vassal Barons](https://github.com/R6mulo/VassalBarons-Mod)**, a mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord that lets you create vassal factions from your own family members.
